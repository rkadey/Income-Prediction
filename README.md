# Machine Learning Project using Jupyter Notebook
This is a machine learning project implemented in Jupyter Notebook. The goal of this project is to predict  whether a given adult makes more than 
$50,000 a year or not using various features such as the age, workclass of the individual, occupation, level of education etc. 

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine. You will also need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installing

To install Jupyter Notebook, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install jupyter notebook
```
## Running the Project

To run the project, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
This will launch Jupyter Notebook in your web browser. From there, you can open the project notebook and run the code.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is the US Adult dataset dataset. It contains information about the individual.

## Methodology

In this project, we will be using a classification model to predict the price of houses. We will start by exploring the data and performing some preprocessing. We will then train the model and evaluate its performance.

## Results

The results of our analysis are as follows:

Our model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test data.
The most important features for predicting house prices were the size of the house and the number of rooms.
## Conclusion
In this project, we successfully implemented a machine learning model to predict the price of houses in a particular city. Our model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test data, which is a good result. We also identified the most important features for predicting house prices, which can be useful for future analysis.
